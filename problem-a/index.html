    <title>Why I like Peter Parker</title>

    <h1>Peter Parker</h1>

    <p>Peter Parker is a New Yorker from Queens who, after being bit by a radioactive spider,</p>
    <p>gains the power of a spider. After inadvertently causing his uncle Ben Parker's death,</p>
    <p>Peter learns a valuable lesson: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. He then</p>
    <p>dons the mask as Spider-Man. He is portrayed by <cite><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2002_film)">Tobey Maguire in the Raimi Trilogy,</a></cite></p>
    <p><cite><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(2012_film)">Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man,</a></cite> and <cite><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming">Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</a></cite></p>
    <p>I like him because: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>He's a friendly guy who does the right thing.</li>
        <li class = 'important'> He's a smart individual that is also responsible.</li>
        <li>I sort of understand his struggle about balancing your work schedule with social life.</li>
    </ul>
